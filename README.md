# Smart Streetlight System using Sunlight and AI

## 1. Participants
최인호, 황석주, 김지우, 장호민

## 2. Background of Development 
1. Functional discrimination is required according to the location of street lamps.
2. Store and use energy efficiently
3. Prevention of pedestrians and accidents in alleys

## 3. Research Goals
Most street lamps always give the same light at any time and only illuminate the light. So in this project, we use sensors or cameras to identify people's coming, control LED lights according to the situation, and use the camera to transmit problem images in case of an emergency. Fine dust and noise can be measured. A street lamp camera on a road with fewer vehicles can be used to control current vehicle traffic or LED. We also want to implement efficient use of solar energy by tracking solar panels along the sun.
